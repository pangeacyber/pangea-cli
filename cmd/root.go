	Short: "Run any application with secrets anywhere using the Pangea secrets CLI",
	Long: `Pangea Secrets CLI lets you store your application secrets in Pangea's secure vault and use them at runtime everywhere.

🤔 How it works: We inject secrets as environment variables into your application, so that you don't have to change your codebase, or use any bulky SDKs. 
😎 Best Part: All your secrets are synced with Pangea's vault`,
	// Uncomment the following line if your bare application
	// has an action associated with it:
	// Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) { },
}

// Execute adds all child commands to the root command and sets flags appropriately.
// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.
func Execute() {
	err := rootCmd.Execute()
	if err != nil {

	// Cobra supports persistent flags, which, if defined here,
	// will be global for your application.

	// rootCmd.PersistentFlags().StringVar(&cfgFile, "config", "", "config file (default is $HOME/.cli.yaml)")

	// Cobra also supports local flags, which will only run
	// when this action is called directly.
